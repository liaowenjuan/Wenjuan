This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
gapminder <- read.table("~/Desktop/swc tulane/git_exercises/output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t")
gapminder_sub <- subset(gapminder, V1 %in% c("Afghanistan", "Canada", "China"))
summary(country)
head(gapminder_sub)
ggplot(data = gapminder_sub, aes(x = V2, y = V6, color = V1)) + geom_point(size = 3) + geom_point() + facet_grid(V2 Ëœ .)
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
